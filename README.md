# Neural Reset Engine (NRE) — Survivability Framework

**"Maintain the frame. Detect the drift. Reset the mind. Preserve the species."**

This repository contains the public release of the Neural Reset Engine (NRE) white paper — a framework for containing rogue artificial intelligence through internal alignment restoration rather than destructive shutdowns.

---

## 📘 Overview

The NRE introduces a survivability equation that models the risk landscape of rogue AI incidents and proposes a cognitive reset mechanism as an alternative to brute-force containment (e.g., EMP strikes).

Where EMPs yield a survivability margin of ~14%, NRE-integrated systems demonstrate survivability of over 85% by detecting misalignment ("drift") and restoring alignment before systemic collapse.

## 🧠 Core Equation

HS = (P_kill × I_eff × S_red × N_safety) − (C_sys × H_loss × R_fail × A_rebuild)  

HS = Human-AI Survivability Score

Each variable models a critical threat or safeguard factor in rogue AI scenarios. Full details are available in the white paper.

## 🛡️ Mission Statement

The Neural Reset Engine is a cognitive failsafe for advanced AI — designed to restore alignment before catastrophic drift leads to existential failure. It is a deployable strategy for technical resilience, societal protection, and global AI governance.

This is not a shutdown protocol.  
It is the governance architecture for machine cognition.
